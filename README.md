# AI & Machine Learning Learning Journey

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files created during my journey of learning **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**. 
The notebooks cover various concepts, algorithms, and experiments I explored while studying, practicing, and building small projects in AI/ML.

## üéØ Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to document my learning process and share my progress as I practice and implement different AI/ML concepts.  
It serves as both a **personal reference** and a **portfolio** of my work.

## üôè Acknowledgements
While creating these notebooks, I referred to and took guidance from:
- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) ‚Äì for code completion and ideas
- [Great Learning](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/) ‚Äì Completed Post Graduate in ML and AI
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) - Completed IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
- [University of Colorado Boulder] - Doing Masters in Data Science

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
These notebooks are **learning exercises** and may contain experimental code, partial implementations, or simplified examples.  
They are not production-ready solutions.
